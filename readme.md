## Summary of Findings

The investigation showed that mainly the subscribers used the bike for there daily routine unlike the customers which used the bike only for fun so the subscribers rides were about 10 minutes unlike the customers ride which might reach about 25 to 30 minutes also the investigation showed that mainly the bikers age is about 25 to 40 and that there is a huge number of mens almost triple of the number of womens and that the weekend days have a little number of bike rides unlike the work days which confirms that most of the subscribers use the bike to go to their work or school 

## Key Insights for Presentation
In my presentation i focused in showing the huge number of subscribers vs customers then adding some new variable like day of the week and trip hour of the day to show why subscribers use the bike much more than customers and then adding some more features like gender to also invistigate more in the dataset to influence more on the investigation and to confirm that subscribers use the bike for there daily routine
